As part of this work, the \gls{3gpp} specification is examined in detail to understand the exact protocol flow and security requirements.
Based on this assessment, a comparison between existing formal verification tools is performed determine the one that best covers the properties of the protocol under test.
The protocol is transformed into a model suitable to be verified by the chosen tool.
Since \gls{3gpp} documents are not written in a strictly formal manner, but rather in prose, the protocol specification may turn out not be mathematically complete.
In this case, explicit assumptions shall be made in to be able to complete the computer-aided verification.
