Chapter~\ref{chap:theory} outlines the theoretical preliminaries implied throughout the remainder of this thesis.
Initially, section~\ref{sec:n32} examines the relevant \gls{3gpp} specifications in detail to establish a firm understanding of all protocol components, messages flows, involved participants, and desired security properties of \gls{prins}.
Particular focus is put on the trust model assumed by the \gls{3gpp} specification.
This first step serves as the basis for transposing the specification into a formal model later on.
Secondly, section~\ref{sec:formal} goes on to describe important theoretical preliminaries of symbolic model checking for the purposes of verifying security protocols.
As part of this, a brief introduction to first-order logic is provided, which serves as the fundamental theory to system verification using formal methods in general.
It is further described what kind of security properties can be verified with this apporach and what known limitations exist.
Subsequently, two popular tools for automated model checking of security protocols, \textsc{Tamarin} prover and \textsc{ProVerif}, are surveyed.
In order to determine the software capable of addressing the requirements of the protocol under test in an optimal way, a comparison is performed in terms of supported security properties and cryptographic primitives.
Aside from the pure security requirements to be verified and a particular tool's feature set --which on their own may not conclusively answer this question-- additional aspects such as the degree of automation and ease of use are also considered, some of which are inevitably subjective.
The decision to use a particular software tool also determines the model that needs to be created in the following step.
While there are attempts to bridge the gap between the aforementioned tools by translating one type of formal model into the other (see \cite{kremer2016automated}), this thesis intentionally focussed on \textsc{Tamarin} and \textsc{ProVerif} in there pure form, without relying on third-party extensions.

Chapter~\ref{chap:modeling} contains a comprehensive description of the verification process.
Section~\ref{sec:model} provides a detailed account of modeling \gls{prins} in a way that is suitable to be verified by the chosen tool.
During this process, the objective is to answer research question~(1) conclusively.
Since \gls{3gpp} documents are not written in a strictly formal manner but rather in prose, the protocol specification may prove not to be perfectly complete -- a point of critique \cite{basin2018model} highlight with respect to the 5G \gls{aka} protocol.
In these cases, explicit assumptions about the intended protocol behavior or requirement shall be made to allow for the completion of the computer-aided verification.
Any such findings or the absence thereof help answering research question~(2), which is to be addressed by concerete suggestions for improvement of the \gls{3gpp} documents, if necessary.

Chapter~\ref{chap:verification} discusses the process of computer-aided verification, the obtained results and their security implications.
Section~\ref{sec:analysis} analyses the issues encountered during execution of the model checking tool as well as the information obtained as a result.
Two kinds of findings are expected at this stage:
Firstly, potential problems while running the software aid the validation of the model created previously.
For example, if the tool does not terminate this may be an indication for the protocol being too loosely defined and more detailed modeling may be required.
Secondly, if an actual flaw in the model is discovered it should be possible to explicitly point out the root cause.
Since symbolic model checkers by design are able to provide a counter example to a property under test in the form of a particular trace that violates it.
Section~\ref{sec:implications} puts these findings into context and outlines the practical security implications on the \gls{prins} protocol.
Where required, recommendations for improving the protocol's specificatiom are provided.

Lastly, chapter~\ref{chap:closing} draws a final conclusion of the formal verification of \gls{prins}, summarizes the contributions of this thesis, and provides suggestions for potential future work based on the findings of this thesis.
