Initially, section \ref{sec:n32} examines the relevant \gls{3gpp} specifications in detail to understand all involved parties, desired security properties, as well as message contents and sequences of \gls{prins}.
Since the protocol features some very distinct requirements, the underlying trust model is discussed in detail.
This first step serves as the basis for transposing the specification into a formal model later on.
Secondly, \ref{sec:formal} goes on to describe the theoretical background of model checking for the purposes of verifying security protocols.
By clarifying the mathematical foundations, this aids the understanding of exactly what kind of potential flaws are detectable in this way.
Subsequently, a comparison between popular model checkers is performed in section \ref{sec:formal}, in order to determine the one that best covers the properties of the protocol under test.
Aside from the security requirements to be verified and a particular tool's feature set --which on their own may not conclusively answer this question-- additional aspects, such as the degree of automation, are also considered.
The choice of software further determines the model created in the next step.
Hence, section \ref{sec:model} provides a detailed account of the process of modeling \gls{prins} in a way that is suitable to be verified by the chosen tool.
Since \gls{3gpp} documents are not written in a strictly formal manner but rather in prose, the protocol specification may prove not to be perfectly complete -- a point of critique \cite{basin2018model} highlight with respect to the 5G \gls{aka} protocol.
In such cases, explicit assumptions shall be made to be able to complete the computer-aided verification.

Afterwards, section \ref{sec:analysis} discusses the issues encountered during execution of the model checker as well as the information obtained as a result.
Section \ref{sec:implications} puts these findings into context and outlines the practical security implications on the \gls{prins} protocol.
Where required, recommendations for improving the protocol's specificatiom are provided.
