This thesis aims to investigate security properties of the 5G inter-operator signaling protocol \gls{prins} using formal verification.
Given the compexity of secure protocol design and the fact that \gls{3gpp} commonly refrains from designing special-purpose ones, it is considered beneficial to analyse \gls{prins} in detail.
Since model checking allows verification based on an abstract specification, or rather a formal model thereof, this work is independent from any particular implementation.
Consequently, proving or disproving properties of the model to be created should result in recommendations to improve the underlying specification.
In summary, the objective is to answer the following three questions:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
    \item Is it possible to comprehensively describe the 5G inter-operator signaling protocol with the methods of formal verification?

    \item Does modeling \gls{prins} in a formal grammar reveal any inconsistencies that need to be addressed by the specification?

    \item Based on the model created as part of this work, can existing formal verification tools proof or disproof particular security requirements of the \gls{prins} protocol?
\end{enumerate}

As the protocol to be verified is comprised of several different technologies, some of them already well understood, there are certain aspects that are considered out of scope.
This includes \gls{tls} version 1.2 and 1.3, which have been subject to formal analysis previously and, in the following, are assumed to be perfectly secure.
The reader is referred to~\cite{horvat2015formal}, \cite{cremers2017comprehensive}, and \cite{van2018analysis} who cover this protocol in great detail.
The same assumption applies to \gls{jwe} and \gls{jws}, which are part of the \gls{jose} suite.
Their profiles as specified in \cite{3gpp.33.210}, using the \gls{aes} in \gls{gcm} and \gls{ecdsa} respectively, are considered perfect.
Analyses of the security properties of these cryptographic algorithms are provided by \cite{mcgrew2004security} as well as \cite{fersch2016provable}.

Furthermore, this thesis intentionally limits itself to the application of existing tools for formal verification, rather than extending them or even developing a new one.
The author is of the opinion that if model checking is to become a common step in the design and standardization of new protocols, the tools need to exhibit general applicability so as to be utilized by respective standardization bodies without immense overhead.
