The idea of proving correctness of concurrent systems, such as network protocols, based on a formal representation exists for several decades already.
Basin, Cremers, and Meadows (2015) provide an extensive description of the historical developments of model checking security protocols, streching back to the 1980s.
Based on their work, this section provides a brief overview of some foundational theories and key contributions in this active field of reasearch.
Additionally, recent work directly related to the application of formal verification to mobile network security is highlighted.

The term 'model checking' goes back to EM Clarke and EA Emerson (1981/85), who are the first to propose computer-aided verification of finite-state systems expressed in temporal logic...
