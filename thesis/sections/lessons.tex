- debugging difficult due to
    - missing information about rule execution
    - unclear what rules may be blocking
    - erroneous results when rules are not executed
    - little indication about termination / non termination
- questionable results of the verification, even when terminating
- strong secrecy not provable, due to natural numbers / predicates
- trace visualization can be bottleneck
- breaking changes in minor versions
